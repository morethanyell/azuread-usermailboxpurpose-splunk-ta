# Splunk Technology Add-on (TA) for Azure Entra ID (AD) Mailbox Settings
Ah, the endless, soul-draining quest for clarity in identity management. Youâ€™d think, in this age of infinite computing power, that figuring out whether an account belongs to a living, breathing human being or some nameless, faceless service mailbox would be trivial. But no. Instead, we scrape, we cross-reference, we build "master lookup tables" in Splunk, and still, we find ourselves staring at data that refuses to tell us anything useful.

If you're in Azure Entra ID (nÃ©e Azure AD, because nothing gold can stay), you might be using TA-MS-AAD or the Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Azure, grabbing `sourcetype=azure:aad:user`. And sure, the Graph API endpoint gives you a heap of dataâ€”especially if you embrace the chaos of the beta versionâ€”but good luck untangling whether an entry represents an actual person or just another shared mailbox, doomed to exist without agency or identity.

Now, if your organization has a clear, rational way of tagging OU in `distinguishedName`, then congratulations, youâ€™ve been spared this particular absurdity. But if not? Well, prepare to drown in a sea of indistinguishable accounts, where every email address is SchrÃ¶dingerâ€™s userâ€”both real and not, until observed.

Microsoft Graph does, at least, offer `mailboxSettings` [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/mailboxsettings), which contains the `userPurpose` fieldâ€”the closest thing to an answer youâ€™re going to get. See here if you feel like chasing meaning in the void.

To save you from existential despair, I built this collector. It pulls the `userPurpose` field and maps it to your Identities using either `id` or `userPrincipalName`. Will it solve all your problems? No. But it might, at least, help you make sense of this ridiculous game we call IT.

_(I had ChatGPT rewrite my TA description to sound like a grumpy Albert Camus ðŸ¤ª)_

## Requirements
- An Azure app-registration (that's your Client ID)
- This Client ID must have `MailboxSettings.Read` permission

## How to make it work
- Install this on your HF or SplunkCloud stack
- Create an input stanza
- Give it a name
- Give it a very long interval (you don't need this that much, once a week is fine: 604800)
- Enter your Client ID, Client Secret, and the Azure Directory Tenant ID
- Enter the index you wish to dump these events (they're not events, btw. just a dump of user accounts with specific information)

## Sample log

```
{
   "id": "6ef43087-2aa7-462d-bb7d-5f6841296f3f",
   "mail": "musk.zuckergates.communications@faang.com",
   "mailboxSettingsUserPurpose": "shared",
   "userPrincipalName": "musk.zuckergates.communications@faang.com"
}
```
